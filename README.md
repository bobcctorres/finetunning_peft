Lightweight Fine-Tuning a HuggingFace (GPT-2) Foundation model over PEFT technique

This project demonstrates the use of the PEFT technique to fine tunning a pre-existing Foundation LLM model, in this case, OpenAI's GPT-2 with the purpose to reuse the LLM learning capabilities extending it into a GLUE language classification operation.
